2009/04/17 Release 1.7

  Main changes since 1.6

  1. header files have been redistributed into sub-directories of
     ${includedir}/kwsPlus:
       ${includedir}/kwsPlus/roadmap
       ${includedir}/kwsPlus/directPath
       ${includedir}/kwsPlus/util
     for backward compatibility, copies of the headers have also been installed
     in ${includedir}/kwsPlus, but a warning message suggests to include the new version.
 
  2. ChppVisRdmbuilder uses the node factory of the roadmap builder instead of 
     creating nodes by itself. Thus, if the user set a node factory to build 
     customized nodes, this node factory is taken into account.
