        7. Class CkwsPlusRoadmap now inherits from CkppKCDAssembly instead
           of CkppKCDPolyhedron, in order to allow roadmap building on
           run-time.
        6. Added a method "lastEdge" to this class. To use with a roadmap
           builder delegate and a progress delegate for a "real-time"
           display
        5. Added class CkwsPlusRoadmap: derives from CkwsRoadmap and from
           CkppKCDPolyhedron and implements a display() method that
           puts the roadmap in the geometry node of the model tree if any.
        4. Documentation is now generated at installation
        3. kwsPlus.doxytag is produced by doxygen and installed.

           externalized in another library in order to be reused for other
           purposes.
        1. Removed reference to package angle. angle is provided by
           flatCarDirectPath.
