2008/02/18      kwsPlus release 1.2
	
        24. In flicDirectPath, curvature bound is enforced at the creation
            of the direct path.
        23. Added CkwsPlusLTRdmBuilder class. Derives from any diffusing
            roadmap builder class and implements a local tree diffusing
            method.
        22. Added CkwsPlusPCARdmBuilder class. Derives from any diffusing
            roadmap builder class and implements a principal component

        19. Merge with git+ssh://softs.laas.fr/git/jrl/kwsPlus
        18. Correct the reeds&sheppDirectPath Class :
              - is now derivated from kwsPlusDirectPath
              - you can acess to uStart and uEnd parameters which are
                configurated with extractTo and extractFrom
              - when you get the RSvectorPartition is now taking count of
                the uStart and uEnd extracting parameters
        17. Added a class to test whether a configuration constraint is
            continuous and is a projection.
        16. Reorganization of documentation.
        15. Added class CkwsPlusDirectPath that manages extraction and
            reverse of direct paths.
        14. Added a class in unitTesting to test whether a configuration
            constraint is a projection.

2007/10/10      kwsPlus release 1.1

        13. Correct a bug in  findRsCurveNumInVector() :
           - put an Epsilon for the test else there is a bug when u ~= val
        12. Added visibility algorithm.
        11. Added a roadmap builder delegate to display the roadmap.
        10. Modified construction of CkwsPlusRoadmap.
        9. Completed the implementation of the Reeds&Shepp Curve
                  - MaxAbsoluteDerivative
                  - Reduce the option RS_ALL type of curve

2007/07/13      kwsPlus release 1.0

        8. Added methods and attributes to keep track of extration and
           reversion of KineoWorks direct paths.
        7. Class CkwsPlusRoadmap now inherits from CkppKCDAssembly instead
           of CkppKCDPolyhedron, in order to allow roadmap building on
           run-time.
        6. Added a method "lastEdge" to this class. To use with a roadmap
           builder delegate and a progress delegate for a "real-time"
           display
        5. Added class CkwsPlusRoadmap: derives from CkwsRoadmap and from
           CkppKCDPolyhedron and implements a display() method that
           puts the roadmap in the geometry node of the model tree if any.
        4. Documentation is now generated at installation
        3. kwsPlus.doxytag is produced by doxygen and installed.
        2. Flatness based computations for carlike robot are now
           externalized in another library in order to be reused for other
           purposes.
        1. Removed reference to package angle. angle is provided by
           flatCarDirectPath.
